Well After this 6 intensive coding bootcamp, I can say I am confident enough to do some fullstack projects, I am also confident enough to follow some code along tutorials and not be lost along the way. GOMYCODE has help me know what skills are needed to do well in this saturated Web development market.

Well I gained frontend skills and backend skills( especially the area of login and authentication of a User login and Sign up process). I have also gained clean modern architecture design model when working on full stack projects. It has also help me hone my Javascript skillset.
